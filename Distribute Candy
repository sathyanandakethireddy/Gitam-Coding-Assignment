# There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.
# You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
# 1. Each child must have at least one candy.
# 2. Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbours.
# What is the minimum candies you must give?
# Input Format:
# The first and the only argument contains N integers in an array A.
# Output Format:
# Return an integer, representing the minimum candies to be given.
# Example:
# Input 1:
# A = [1, 2]
# Output 1:
# 3
# code:
def candy(A):
    n = len(A)
    candies = [1] * n

    # Iterate from left to right
    for i in range(1, n):
        if A[i] > A[i - 1]:
            candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1

    # Iterate from right to left
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if A[i] > A[i + 1]:
            candies[i] = max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1)

    # Calculate the total number of candies
    total_candies = sum(candies)

    return total_candies

# Example usage:
try:
    input_array = list(map(int, input("Enter the ratings separated by space: ").split()))
    result = candy(input_array)
    print(f"The minimum candies required are: {result}")
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter valid integers separated by space.")
